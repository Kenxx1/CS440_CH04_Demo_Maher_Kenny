# CS440_CH04_Demo_Maher_Kenny

I chose the GNU GPLv3 liscense for this repository because I'm a supporter of improving and sharing open source software. If I created a signficant project that other people would enjoy I would like to make my software free for all people and guarentee that it continues to be free. This type of liscense gives me freedom to distrubute copies and make changes to the software down the line.  The GNU GPLv3 liscense is also ideal for open source shared development because anyone working on a derivative of my code must make their source avaialable under the same terms. Overall, I think that this patent aligns with my ideals of how I would like my code to be used, I would not want my liscence to restrict future development in any way and I would like to share ideas and future derivatives of the code in a constructive enviroment.
